    "## Introduction to Hyparmeters\n",
    "### What are Parameters?\n",
    "- Parameters are values that are learned by a machine learning model during training.\n",
    "  They are adjusted to minimize the loss function and improve the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   These values are optimized from the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "- Coefficients in Linear Regression\n",
    "   *E.g., the slope and intercept in a straight-line model.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weights and biases in Neural Networks\n",
    "   *E.g.,the connection strength between neurons.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### What are Hyperparameters?\n",
    "- Hyperparameters are settings defined before training begins.\n",
    "  They control the learning process of the model but are not learned from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Hyperparameters are set manually or tuned using optimization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "- Maximum depth of decision trees\n",
    "  *E.g., limiting how deep a tree can go to prevent overfitting.*\n",
    "- Learning rate in gradient descent\n",
    " *E.g., how big a step we take during optimization.*\n",
    "- Number of estimators in ensemble models\n",
    "  *E.g., how many trees to build in a Random Forest.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Tune Hyperparameters?\n",
    "  Tuning hyperparameters is essential because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improves Model Generalization\n",
    "   - Proper tuning helps the model perform well on unseen data.\n",
    "2. Prevents Overfitting/Underfitting\n",
    "    - For instance, a tree with no depth limit may overfit; one that's too shallow may underfit.\n",
    "3. Saves Time and Resources\n",
    "   - Optimal hyperparameters can lead to faster training and efficient computation.\n",
    "4. Tailors Model to Data\n",
    "   - Different datasets need different settings to bring out the best model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Hyperparameters (by Model Type)\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Tree-Based Models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests)\n",
    "- **`max_depth`**: Controls the depth of the tree.  \n",
    "- **`min_samples_split`**: Minimum number of samples required to split a node.  \n",
    "- **`n_estimators`**: Number of trees in an ensemble model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Boosting Models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)\n",
    "- **`learning_rate`**: Determines how much each tree contributes to the overall prediction.  \n",
    "- **`subsample`**: Fraction of the training data used per iteration.  \n",
    "- **`max_depth`**: Limits tree complexity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "####  Neural Networks\n",
    "- **`learning_rate`**: Step size used in gradient descent to update weights.  \n",
    "- **`num_layers`**: Total depth of the neural network.  \n",
    "- **`batch_size`**: Number of training examples used in one forward/backward pass.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hands-On Exercise\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "- Train a model using default hyperparameters, evaluate its performance, and then manually adjust a few hyperparameters to observe how performance changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìä Dataset:\n",
    "We'll use the Iris Dataset:\n",
    "- A simple multi-class classification dataset.\n",
    "- Already well-balanced and optimal, so tuning might not show drastic changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:\n",
    "- Even though we‚Äôll perform hyperparameter tuning, the Iris dataset might not show significant improvements due to its simplicity and balanced nature.\n",
